```bash
# 1. Navigate to the original repository on GitHub
# https://github.com/[original-repo]/flutter_instagram_app

# 2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
# This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account

# 3. Clone your forked repository
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/flutter_instagram_app.git
cd flutter_instagram_app

# 4. Add the original repository as upstream (for updates)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/[original-repo]/flutter_instagram_app.git

# 5. Create your development branch
git checkout -b training/[your-name]
```

#### 2. Environment Setup

```bash
# Install Flutter dependencies
flutter pub get

flutter doctor

# Run the app to ensure everything works
flutter run
```

#### 3. Create Your Training Repository

```bash
# Create a new repository for your training progress
# Go to GitHub and create a new repository: flutter-instagram-training-[your-name]

# Add your training repo as a remote
git remote add training https://github.com/[your-username]/flutter-instagram-training-[your-name].git
